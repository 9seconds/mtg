# SNI-routing deployment for mtg

A turnkey `docker compose` setup that puts an SNI-aware TCP router
(HAProxy) in front of mtg **and** a real web server (Caddy with
automatic HTTPS).

## Why

Modern DPI systems actively probe suspected proxies.  If the server
closes the connection or returns something unexpected, the IP gets
flagged.  With this setup:

- **Telegram clients** connect to port 443, HAProxy sees the configured
  SNI and routes them to mtg (FakeTLS).
- **Everything else** (browsers, DPI probes, scanners) is routed to
  Caddy, which responds with a real Let's Encrypt certificate and serves
  genuine web content.

Because your domain's DNS points to this server, the SNI/IP match is
natural and passive DPI has nothing to flag.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Point your domain's DNS A/AAAA record to this server's IP.

# 2. Generate an mtg secret:
docker run --rm nineseconds/mtg:2 generate-secret --hex YOUR_DOMAIN

# 3. Edit the config files:
#    - mtg-config.toml  →  paste the secret
#    - haproxy.cfg       →  replace "example.com" in the SNI ACL
#    - .env or export    →  DOMAIN=your.domain

# 4. (Optional) put your site content into www/

# 5. Start:
docker compose up -d

# 6. Verify:
#    - Open https://YOUR_DOMAIN in a browser → you should see the web page
#    - Configure Telegram with the proxy link from:
docker compose exec mtg mtg access /config/config.toml
```

## ACME (Let's Encrypt) notes

HAProxy passes `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` requests on `:80` to
Caddy so that HTTP-01 validation works out of the box.  Make sure your
domain's DNS A/AAAA record points to this server before starting.
