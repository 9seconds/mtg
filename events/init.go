// Events has a default implementations of EventStream for mtglib.
//
// Please see documentation for mtglib.EventStream interface to get an
// idea of such an abstraction. This package has implementations for the
// default event stream.
//
// Default event stream has a list of its own concepts. First, all it
// does is a routing of messages to known observers. It takes an event,
// defines its type and pass this message to a method of the observer.
//
// There might be many observers, but default event stream has a
// guarantee though. It uses StreamID as a sharding key and guarantees
// that a message with the same StreamID will be devlivered to the same
// observer instance. So, each producer is guarateed to get all relevant
// messages related to the same session. It is not possible that it will
// get EventFinish if it has not seen EventStart for that session yet.

// Observer is an instance that listens for the incoming events.
//
// As it is said in the package description, the default event stream
// guarantees that all events with the same StreamID are going to be
// routed to the same instance of the observer. So, there is no need
// to synchronize information about streams between many observers
// instances, they can have their local storage.

	// Shutdown stop observer. Default event stream guarantees:
	//   1. If shutdown is executed, it is executed only once
	//   2. Observer won't receieve any new message after this
	//      function call.
	Shutdown()
}

// ObserverFactory creates a new instance of the observer.
//
// Default event stream creates a small set of goroutines to manage
// incoming messages. Each message is routed to an appropriate observer
// based on a sharding key, stream id. So, it is possible that an
// instance of mtg will have many observer instances, not a single one.
