#
# As for 2.0, if you set a public-ip on your own, mtg won't issue any
# network requests except of those required for Telegram.
#
# so, in order of doing them, it needs to do DNS lookup. mtg ignores DNS

# By default we use Cloudflare.

# Starting from mtg v2.1.12 we have changed a configuration for DNS. Now it

#  - https://1.1.1.1
#  - https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
#  - https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
#  - https://cloudflare-dns.com
#
# Here is how to define DNS-over-TLS:
#  - tls://1.1.1.1
#  - tls://cloudflare-dns.com
#
# Here is how to define a custom UDP resolver (we support only IPs here)
#  - 1.1.1.1
#  - udp://1.1.1.1
#
# If you set it to empty string, default resolver will be used.
# But please comment out doh-ip

# mtg can work via proxies (for now, we support only socks5). Proxy
# configuration is done via list. So, you can specify many proxies

# If you supply >= 2, then mtg will load balance between them.
#
# If you add an empty string here, this is an equivalent of 'plain network',
# with no proxy usage.
#
# Proxy configuration is done via ordinary URI schema:
#
