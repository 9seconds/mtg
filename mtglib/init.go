// mtglib defines a package with MTPROTO proxy.
//
// Since mtg itself is build as an example of how to work with mtglib,
// it worth to telling a couple of words about a project organization.
//
// A core object of the project is mtglib.Proxy. This is a proxy you
// expect: that one which you configure, set to serve on a listener
// and/or shutdown on application termination.
//
// But it also has a core logic unrelated to Telegram per se: anti
// replay cache, network connectivity (who knows, maybe you want to have
// a native VMESS integration) and so on.
//
// You can supply such parts to a proxy with interfaces. The rest of
// the packages in mtg define some default implementations of these
// interfaces. But if you want to integrate it with, let say, influxdb,
// you can do it easily.

// AntiReplayCache is an interface that is used to detect replay attacks
// based on some traffic fingerprints.
//
// Replay attacks are probe attacks whose main goal is to identify if
// server software can be classified in some way. For example, if you
// send some HTTP request to a web server, then you can expect that this
// server will respond with HTTP response back.
//
// There is a problem though. Let's imagine, that connection is
// encrypted. Let's imagine, that it is encrypted with some static key
// like ShadowSocks (https://shadowsocks.org/assets/whitepaper.pdf).
// In that case, in theory, if you repeat the same bytes, you can get
// the same responses. Let's imagine, that you've cracked the key. then
// if you send the same bytes, you can decrypt a response and see its
// structure. Based on its structure you can identify if this server is
// SOCKS5, MTPROTO proxy etc.
//
// This is just one example, maybe not the best or not the most
// relevant. In real life, different organizations use such replay
// attacks to perform some reverse engineering of the proxy, do some
// statical analysis to identify server software.
//
// There are many ways how to protect your proxy against them. One
// is domain fronting which is a core part of mtg. Another one is to
// collect some 'handshake fingerprints' and forbid duplication.
//
// So, it one is sending the same byte flow right after you (or a couple
// of hours after), mtg should detect that and reject this connection
// (or redirect to fronting domain).
type AntiReplayCache interface {

	// not. If it is required to store this information somewhere else,
	// then it has to do that.

// IPBlocklist filters requests based on IP address.
//
// If this filter has an IP address, then mtg closes a request without
// reading anything from a socket. It also does not give such request to
// a worker pool, so in worst cases you can expect that you invoke this
// object more frequent than defined proxy concurrency.

// Event is a data structure which is populated during mtg request
// processing lifecycle. Each request popluates many events:
//
// 1. Client connected
//
// 2. Request is finished
//
// 3. Connection to Telegram server is established
//
// and so on. All these events are data structures but all of them
// must conform the same interface.

//
// The idea is simple. When mtg works, it emits a set of events during
// a lifecycle of the requestor: EventStart, EventFinish etc. mtg is a
// producer which puts these events into a stream. Responsibility of
// the stream is to deliver this event to consumers/observers. There
// might be many different observers (for example, you want to have both
// statsd and prometheus), mtg should know nothing about them.
type EventStream interface {

// Logger defines an interface of the logger used by mtglib.
//
// Each logger has a name. It is possible to stack names to organize

// Example
//
//     logger := SomeLogger{}
//     logger = logger.BindStr("ip", net.IP{127, 0, 0, 1})
//     logger.Info("Hello")
//
// In that case, ip is bound as a parameter. It is a great idea to
// put this parameter somewhere in a log message.
//
//     logger1 = logger.BindStr("param1", "11")
//     logger2 = logger.BindInt("param2", 11)
//
// logger1 should see no param2 and vice versa, logger2 should not see param1
// If you attach a parameter to a logger, parents should not know about that.
